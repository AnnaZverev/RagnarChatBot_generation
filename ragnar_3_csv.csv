"\""I'll settle for a husband,\"" she said, \""and a bellyful of laughter.\""",Ragnar: This is going to be a long story.
"Seer: If you are hundreds of years old, Then it's a very quick story.",Ragnar: Hmm.

Rollo: Why do you keep making concessions to Horik?,Ragnar: Because he is the king.

We are not wolves or pigs.,Ragnar: It is natural.

Why?,Ragnar: So he knows that we are here to talk...
And you did that without consulting with me.,Ragnar: I thought you would both agree.
King Horik: Why should you think that?,Ragnar: Because it is a sensible policy.

"So, what do you propose now?",Ragnar: Wait.
Lagertha: For what?,Ragnar: The unexpected.
He hopes that you will be prepared to talk to him.,Ragnar: I am prepared.
"And my father also sends you this, as a token of his good will.",Ragnar: This is Athelstan's.
"You have his guarantee of safe passage, as well as my father's.",Ragnar: Then...
Perhaps then you could be at peace with yourself.,"Ragnar: King Horik, your behaviour has made it very difficult to talk peace or to negotiate with King Ecbert."
"Lagertha: If we defeat Ecbert in battle, he may be prepared to offer us more in terms not only of gold, but of land.",Ragnar: This was a gift in good faith.
They're fleas and vermin.,Ragnar: I will go myself and talk to him.

Athelstan: I will give him your answer.,"Ragnar: I will accompany you, part of the way."
(Leather creaks with tension),Ragnar: (Sighs)

King Ecbert and the Princess are willing to pay any of your warriors a fat fee for fighting for her.,Ragnar: What about my brother?
"Athelstan: The King will agree to release Rollo upon your acceptance of his offer, and upon the safe return of King Aelle.",Ragnar: I accept the offer.
(Floki hisses),"Ragnar: Hello, brother."
(Rollo grunts in pain),Ragnar: I am taking my brother home. Will you come back with us or will you stay here with... your people?
"Once a simple farmer, he, too, yearned to understand.",Ragnar: I believe there's a way to go west using this.
Floki: Will it be strong enough?,Ragnar: We won't know that until we try.
It is their way.,Ragnar: It was easy to take all of these things.
A warrior I trust goes with you. Knut?,Ragnar: You will not regret this.
What are we waiting for?,Ragnar: Until the odds are in our favor.
Athelstan voiceover: And inspired leadership always wins the hearts of men.,Ragnar: Who are you?
Hmm.,Ragnar: Shall we go visit the king?
It is a consolation devoutly to be wished.,"Ragnar: Every nine years, we travel to the temple at Uppsala to give thanks to the gods and to offer them sacrifices for all they do for us."
Athelstan: What is this?,Ragnar: These will all be killed as sacrifices.
Athelstan voiceover: But blood can be the broadest of wedges.,Ragnar: I see no reason why you two should not get on together.
I must find my family.,Ragnar: I want you to stay here.
"If I can be of help to King Horik, then I am happy to stay.","Ragnar: I'm surprised to hear you say that, for you know my family better than anyone."
"For savagery sometimes hides its face, only to leer from the shadows again, lustier than before.",Ragnar: Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?
Bjorn: What is a blood eagle?,Ragnar: The offender gets down on his knees. And his back is opened. And then his ribs are chopped away from his spine. And then his lungs are pulled out of this huge bleeding wound and laid upon his shoulders so they look like the folded wings of a great eagle.
"Once a simple farmer, he, too, yearned to understand.",Ragnar: I believe there's a way to go west using this.
Knut.,Ragnar: You will not regret this.
But I don't see my friend... Knut. Where is he?,Ragnar: I killed him.
Rollo: You see them up there?,Ragnar: Yes.
What are we waiting for?,Ragnar: Until the odds are in our favour.

"Athelstan: If I can be of help to King Horik, then I am happy to stay.",Ragnar: I am surprised to hear you say that.
I knew you were coming back.,Ragnar: What did you call him?
"For savagery sometimes hides its face, only to leer from the shadows again, lustier than before.",Ragnar: Did you really think that I could ever forgive this man?

He fights.,Ragnar: And...?
He looks after his family.,Ragnar: That's right.
What do you mean? You look after us.,Ragnar: Say I wasn't there.
"Looking a little pale, Bjorn.","Ragnar: Why don't you go lie down, hmm?"
Those bastards to the east are as poor as we are.,Ragnar: I know.
(Water pours and sloshes in bowl),"Ragnar: Now, this candle is the sun."
Rollo: Then you are too far South and must steer more to the north.,Ragnar: That's it!
"Bjorn: Why is he smiling, father?","Ragnar: He wants to die well, without fear, to atone for his sins."
Why did he do that?,Ragnar: He should not have done that.
Earl Haraldson: (Sword clanks) Let us feast!,"Ragnar: My lord, we all want to feast, but we also want to know where we will be raiding this summer."
"We will raid east again, to the Eastlands, and into Russia.",Ragnar: Every year we go to the same places!
(Crowd cheers and applauds),Ragnar: Let me see!
in private.,Ragnar: Stay with your Uncle.
"Why are you so certain that it's a land of great riches, hmm?",Ragnar: I can't be sure.
Bjorn: Where are we going now? I'm so tired.,Ragnar: To talk to the gods.
Ancient seer: What do you want?,Ragnar: I want to know what the gods have in store.
But they can withdraw their goodwill at any time.,"Ragnar: To have this great future, must I challenge the law?"
What are you afraid of?,Ragnar: Wait outside.
(Rain patters lightly),Ragnar: We have someone special to visit.
Like Loki the God?,"Ragnar: Yes, only different."
(Man shrieks and laughs),"Ragnar: Floki, this is my son, Bjorn."
Unfortunately.,Ragnar: Why unfortunately?
I can look inside the tree.,Ragnar: Floki is a boat-builder...
Do you imagine ships are just dead things?,Ragnar: So... what about our boat?

Not be happy?!,"Ragnar: Floki, sit down."
"(grunts, thunks on the floor)",Ragnar: Release the ravens.
(Gulls cry overhead),Ragnar: Woo!
Man: It works! Yeah! Man: We made it!,Ragnar: Row! We made it!
(Door bangs shut),Ragnar: They know we're here.
(They laugh),Ragnar: Perhaps they think their God protects them.
Athelstan: (ln old Norse) Don't kill me.,Ragnar: You speak our language.
"(Gasps, frightened)",Ragnar: How do you speak our language?
"Please, don't kill me.",Ragnar: What is that you have in your hand?
(Snaps book shut),"Ragnar: Of all the treasures I see in this place, you chose to save this?"
Just these strange men.,Ragnar: I believe they are the priests of their God.
We have no room left on the boat.,Ragnar: I forbid it.
Look!,Ragnar: Keep them moving!
They cannot prevail.,Ragnar: The Earl knows nothing about our new boat.
(Gulls cry),"Ragnar: (Quietly) We did it, brother."
"Brother Cenwulf here, beside me, I think he's dead.",Ragnar: You're right.

(Quietly reading aloud),Ragnar: (Whispering) Athelstan.
"Come and join us, priest.",Ragnar: Come on.
No more.,Ragnar: We don't like those in our house to go hungry or thirsty.
So what do you want?,Ragnar: I want to sail west again.
Earl Haraldson: And what are we to do with his customs?,"Ragnar: He has informed me of a large town, near to the temple that we raided before."
Athelstan: No! I was lying! There's nothing there!,Ragnar: Shhh!
(Slices rope),Ragnar: Run away if you want.
(Wood frame creaks),Ragnar: I have the Earl's permission to sail back to england.
How soon is that?,Ragnar: Tomorrow.
But who is to be in charge?,Ragnar: The priest.
"Father! You cannot place a slave above me, your natural son.",Ragnar: I don't regard him as a slave.
Gyda: I don't mind. I like the priest.,Ragnar: (Smiles) Hmm...
Rollo: Why did you give everything away so easily?,"Ragnar: Believe me, this is not the end."
Knut: I will take very close care of your interests.,Ragnar: I want to leave as soon as possible.

"(Chickens cluck, pigs snort)",Ragnar: Ungh!
A man can rape his female slave but not a free woman.,"Ragnar: It is true that we distinguish between those captured in battle, and our own free men and women."
But I would like to be a free man.,Ragnar: If it matters so much to you.
Lagertha: You're hurt.,Ragnar: We have to go now.
Bjorn: Father please tell me?,Ragnar: We have to get to the boat.
"Bjorn: Father, I won't go without you.","Ragnar: Boy, don't argue!"
Svein: Ragnar Lothbrok!,Ragnar: I'm right behind you. Now go.
How are you?,Ragnar: Save me from these people.
Floki: Let's eat.,Ragnar: It is good to see you.
"Just eat your soup, priest.",Ragnar: Sometimes your God sounds a lot like one of ours.
(Flames crackle),Ragnar: Why did the gods keep me alive?
Torstein: What are you going to do?,Ragnar: I can do nothing until I am well.
The boat is her dowry.,Ragnar: Floki can always build us another one.
(Everyone snickers),"Ragnar: No, there are many halls."
Gyda: When will he be better?,Ragnar: It's taken too long already.
(Grunts),Ragnar: Floki.
This is not the only place for us.,Ragnar: He is old.
That is our way.,Ragnar: Who sets the odds?
Lagertha: You don't believe that and neither do I.,Ragnar: You are wrong: I do believe it.
(Footsteps scuff),Ragnar: Don't look so worried.
"Leif: Lord Ragnar, I have come to swear to you my allegiance and fealty to you and your family from this day.","Ragnar: Leif, you are my friend."
"Which is why, I beg you, lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle, and join my friends in Valhalla.",Ragnar: (Grunts in pain)
She wants to die?,Ragnar: These other servants are preparing her.
How soon will they come?,Ragnar: Soon enough.
Rollo: You see them up there?,"Ragnar: Yes, I can see them."
(Ragnar blows his nose),Ragnar: Who are you?
"I'm lord Aethelwulf, brother of king Aelle.","Ragnar: You are the brother of the king, yet you lead his army?"
Floki: I'm hungry already!,Ragnar: What ails you my friend?
Rollo: Who is this?,Ragnar: This?
How long will it take them to raise another army?,"Ragnar: Attack, attack, attack!"
Rollo: Listen to me: If we agree to walk into his house he can kill each and every one of us.,"Ragnar: You forget, we hold his brother hostage."
Leif: (Speaking old norse),Ragnar: Hello.
"I do not think I heard you properly, Ragnar Lothbrok.",Ragnar: (Lightly) Hmm...
I agree to the terms.,Ragnar: (Belches) Good.
You must return my brother.,"Ragnar: When we receive payment, you shall have your brother."
And not an enemy.,Ragnar: You want one of us to become Christian?
(Men chatter),Ragnar: (Breathing hard)
(Deep inhale and exhale),"Ragnar: Every nine years, we travel to the temple at Uppsala, to give thanks to the gods and to offer them sacrifices for all they do for us."
Hail to the gods and goddesses...,"Ragnar: Lord of lords, father, hear my prayer."
"Men: (Howling, barking and laughing)","Ragnar: Can you feel it, Gyda?"
Arne and Torstein: (Chuckles),Ragnar: Give Athelstan a drink.
Lagertha: I heard a rumor today that King Horik himself may attend the festival.,Ragnar: It is not a rumor.
<U+266A>,"Ragnar: Athelstan, I want you to meet someone."
"Please, please.","Ragnar: Travelers and storytellers have described how you came to your throne by defeating, one by one, the six uncles that killed your father."
"And my mother, and all my sisters and brothers.","Ragnar: I also know how you favor the poets at your court, and your people respect your law making, your justice, and your rule."
He has not renounced his false God.,Ragnar: Looks like your God finally came through for you.
Please stay.,"Ragnar: Lord of lords, who will bear me my son?"
That's all I have to say.,Ragnar: He wants to make peace with you and come to some kind of agreement.
"Jarl Borg: If I invade and defeat him, will he not be even more humiliated?",Ragnar: Not if he fights well.
Why else would I assert my claim?,"Ragnar: King Horik resists your claim, but still, in good faith, he is willing to settle with you."
(Borg's men laugh),"Ragnar: Well then, it seems I am done."
Why not?,Ragnar: I have not been given the authority to... negotiate in this manner.
(Ragner slaps the guards' shields),Ragnar: Floki!
Don't you?,Ragnar: I never knew that fresh fish was also packed in salt.
(Birds chirp),"Ragnar: \""I hung from a windy tree for nine long nights, wounded by a spear, dedicated to Odin, from that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.\"""
(Gasping and sighing with pleasure),Ragnar: (Whispers)
"Previously on \""Vikings\"":",Ragnar: We shall finally go west again.
"Hello, priest.",Ragnar: Do you ever miss England?
"(Foliage crunching underfoot, morning doves cry)",Ragnar: What is that place?
"(Warriors grunt, chest thuds heavily)",Ragnar: How did you know?
"(Warriors laugh excitedly, objects clatter)",Ragnar: Who was this?
King Horik: Here! There's more!,Ragnar: You keep talking to me like I know what a Saint is.
(Giggles),"Ragnar: So tell me, how do you find England?"
(Nervously clears throat),"Ragnar: Well, that depends."
Bishop Edmund: Upon what?,Ragnar: Upon what he'll offer us to leave... or what he'll offer us to stay.
Stay?,"Ragnar: Yes, we want to make peace with the king."
(Footsteps echo slightly),Ragnar: Who made all of these things?
Horik: What else did this King of Wessex have to say?,Ragnar: That he might offer us land.
"Can you trust him, this Christian?",Ragnar: He wants something in return.
I think he is afraid of us and will make some deal to our advantage.,Ragnar: You can't even speak their language.
"Horik: If you will permit this man, Athelstan, to remain with me, he can do the talking.",Ragnar: Athelstan is a free man.
Captain: Lower it! Pull it!,Ragnar: Are my family here?
Ubbe: Father!,Ragnar: Little man.
Hvitserk: Father!,"Ragnar: Hello, son. Oh, I've missed you."
Thank the gods!,Ragnar: You still have it. Ubbe: Yes.
"No, we cannot have s*x. Not for three days.",Ragnar: No more prophecies.
Welcome to this shithole we call home.,Ragnar: Shall we talk?
(Latch rattles),Ragnar: I want to attack Kattegat. Now!
I have brought these warriors to help you.,Ragnar: And you are?
(Affectionate slaps),Ragnar: Far too long.
